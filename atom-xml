  <title>How to Purchase Auction Items on Ethair.</title>
  <author><name>Ethair</name><email>boogs@ethair.com</email></author>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="content">
 <p>
First thing’s first, a user finds an item they are interested in.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/interested-item.png" alt="interested-item.png"></img></figure> <p>
Auctions on Ethair have a time limit set by the seller. They can last
up to thirty days or be as short as a few minutes.
</p>

 <p>
The buyer will input the highest amount they are willing to pay for
the item into the bid input field. They will be prompted to confirm
the bid or be able to revise the max amount. If they are the first
bidder, our system will automatically bid at the asking price. The max
bid they input will be set in the background.
</p>

 <p>
If the next bidder comes in and makes an offer that is more than the
asking price, but less than that max bid, then the system will bid for
the user at $1 over the other bid. It will continue to do that after
each bid until the user’s max bid is reached.
</p>

 <p>
If a seller has set a reserve price then the bid the the buyer places
might not necessarily increase by $1. It will increase up to the
maximum bid set by the buyer — but only if the current bid price is
set less that the reserve price.
</p>

 <p>
For example: an item listed with has zero bids with a starting price
of $15. The seller sets the reserve price at $85. The reserve price is
only seen by seller. A buyer bids $75, their bid is set at that
price. If another buyer comes in and puts a max bid of $100 then the
system will bid $85 as that is the reserve price..
</p>

 <p>
Auctions are such that if the bidding doesn’t reach the reserve price,
the item does not sell to the bidders. The price has to cross that
threshold in order for the sale to happen, otherwise the auction
cancels.
</p>

 <p>
If a user gets outbid, our system will let them know via our messaging
widget, so they can take action and increase the bid if they wish.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/message.png" alt="message.png"></img></figure> <p>
Our automated proxy bidding system will make sure the user is always
the highest bidder up to the maximum amount that was set. A user’s
maximum bid can be increased at any time by entering a new amount in
the bid window.
</p>

 <p>
The auction listing page shows users how many bids were placed so far
on the item. It also will allow them to track the bids they placed, as
well as bids placed by other users. The page will also show users
which bids were proxy bids.
</p>

 <p>
Once a user places a bid on an item, it will automatically be added to
their ‘Watch List’, which can be found under the ‘Lists’ icon in the
header.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/watch-list.png" alt="watch-list.png"></img></figure> <p>
Once the auction is won, the item will automatically be added to the
user’s cart, where they can finish the checkout process and complete
the transaction.
</p>

 <p>
If the user is paying with cryptocurrency, then they will go through
our secure escrow process. If they are paying with their local
currency, the transaction continues as a typical online sale.
</p>

 <p>
We look forward to showcasing more of our features as it gets closer
to the launch date!

  <title>Hi. We’re Ethair.</title>
  <author><name>Ethair</name><email>boogs@ethair.com</email></author>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="content">
 <p>
In the last few years cryptocurrencies have exploded. What started
with Bitcoin has expanded as a form of microeconomics. However, one of
the downfalls has been how to spend these new currencies.
</p>

 <p>
That’s where we come in.
</p>

 <p>
Imagine being able to buy your everyday household items and much more
with the cryptocurrency you’ve amassed. We’ve made that a reality.
</p>

 <p>
In the making since 2018 and launching in the third quarter of 2021 is
this new digital marketplace.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/credit-card.jpeg" alt="credit-card.jpeg"></img></figure> <p>
With Ethair, buyers and sellers have the flexibility to choose what
type of currency they deal in, either crypto or local currency. Local
currency transactions are processed through Stripe. Crypto payments
will be processed using a secure escrow account. Additionally, there
is the option to use a fixed price or an auction.
</p>

 <p>
Both parties earn points with each transaction and those points can be
used for future transactions.
</p>

 <p>
The current supported cryptos are: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin,
Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash and Z Cash. There are more to come
and this list is subject to change.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/bitcoin-cash.jpeg" alt="bitcoin-cash.jpeg"></img></figure> <p>
Users can fill out the  <a href="https://www.ethair.com/">early registration form</a> on the website now in
order to take advantage of the rewards pool. These rewards will be
revealed at a later date. There is also a referral system where users
get rewards for each member that signs up using their link.
</p>

 <p>
The exact launch date is still TBD. There is so much more that Ethair
offers and more information will come as it get closer to launch!

  <title>Ethair Market is Taking on Amazon and eBay in a Move to Revolutionize the World of E-Commerce</title>
  <author><name>Ethair</name><email>boogs@ethair.com</email></author>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="content">
 <figure> <img src="../assets/pitch.png" alt="pitch.png"></img></figure> <p>
 <b>Ethair Market is a next generation online global marketplace where you</b>
 <b>can trade goods using fiat or cryptocurrency and earn points on every</b>
 <b>purchase. The marketplace is soon to be launched in the U.S. and</b>
 <b>Canada, with fiat payments support lined up for 43 more countries. You</b>
 <b>can earn ETHR tokens now as an early registration reward and future</b>
 <b>developments such as an NFT marketplace integration are already in the</b>
 <b>works.</b>
</p>

 <p>
 <b>Introducing the Next Generation of eCommerce</b>
</p>

 <p>
 <a href="https://www.ethair.com">Ethair Market</a> incorporates the modern technologies that the
traditional marketplaces are too afraid to tackle. It gives buyers and
sellers an ability to operate with fiat currencies as well as selected
cryptocurrencies. The developers have integrated Stripe for fiat
payments which will allow the marketplace to support 45 countries,
staying complaint with laws and regulations, and expand
internationally with ease. At the upcoming launch the system will
initially support the U.S. and Canada.
</p>

 <p>
For purchases using cryptocurrencies Ethair Market utilizes an escrow
service which increases security on both ends of the spectrum as funds
are held by the marketplace while the goods are being delivered. If
something goes wrong during the process both parties may try to
resolve it themselves or involve Ethair Market to step in and
investigate. Escrow service gives both buyer and seller the security
that the funds will be rightly deposited on the item’s
arrival. Furthermore, it helps sellers deal with fraudulent buyers,
deterring them with escrow deposit and keeping the seller safe from
unexpected refunds.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/market.jpeg" alt="market.jpeg"></img></figure> <p>
EthairPay is the proprietary payment processing platform that will
allow users to make purchases and sales with cryptocurrency. It
currently supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar,
Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, USDC and Ethair Token. The goal is to
update this payment platform to such extent that third parties may
seamlessly integrate it with their stores as well as add support for
NFTs and Semi-NFTs on different blockchains.
</p>

 <p>
The Points reward system gives points to both buyer and the seller on
each successful transaction. These points can be used to decrease the
price of future purchases or boost the listed item desirability, as
well as to mint ETHR tokens. Ethair Market’s ETHR Token allows for
transactions between buyer and the seller without additional
transaction fee charges. Fees which are drastically lower than on
traditional marketplaces are decreased even further with the Points
reward system.
</p>

 <p>
Currently the only way to obtain ETHR token is via early registration,
where for limited time users earn 100 ETHR tokens  <a href="https://www.ethair.com/">by signing up here</a>.
Ethair is also currently running a referral program for a 1 year
period where users are able to invite new users to the platform and
for every referred user that made a purchase they’ll earn a share of
ETHR Token from the Referral Program pool which is based upon the
number of Points to ETHR Token conversions.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/headphones.jpg" alt="headphones.jpg"></img></figure> <p>
 <b>Cheapest Way to Sell Online</b>
</p>

 <p>
If you are an online merchant looking to expand to a new platform that
treats you more fairly than the current marketplaces, Ethair Market is
the perfect place for you. For starters, Ethair Market has much lower
fees than the traditional markets, meaning that everything from
Insertion fees to FVF and various listing “upgrades” are lower than
most traditional marketplace fees.
</p>

 <p>
With a Market (fixed price items, new items only) and “Buy Offer Bid”
(auction items, new or used) selling formats, you are able to sell as
a direct checkout as well as auctioning the items.  <b>You sell, you
choose.</b> On top of traditional marketing schemes, Ethair Market offers
unique ways to promote your sales. For example, by adding Points to
your listings, you increase desirability with the buyers as they get
more rewards for purchasing your items.
</p>

 <p>
The Ethair store manager allows you to easily manage your listings,
bulk upload, sync your listings count with your inventory stock and
across multiple selling platforms, easily message the sellers, check
which sales are pending shipping. Ethair Market also has multiple
return policy rules which allow you to select the return rules under
your own terms. Additional features allow you to customize your store
to your liking, create your own categories and sort items in order to
allow buyers to easily find desired items. You can also advertise
selected store categories only. And verified sellers even have the
ability to edit the store profile’s HTML code.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/fees.png" alt="fees.png"></img></figure> <p>
As for future developments, the next big step for Ethair is the
implementation of the NFT marketplace. This section is planned to have
drastically lower fees, help the buyers and the sellers who are not
tech savvy and introduce novelties to the whole system. Semi-NFTs are
also on the developers’ radar and the EthairPay payment processor is
on track to become compatible with every mintable state, as well as
different blockchain smart contracts.
</p>

 <p>
Expansion into warehouse services is also on the list of future
developments, as Ethair’s goal is to offer the best from all the
traditional marketplaces and provide everything required for any type
of seller. Another plan is to include a social media platform
(“0xHello”) that would be inter-operable with the marketplace in order
to easily create, list and sell NFTs. This would create a new and
never seen before branch where influencers could potentially monetize
every post they make, sell limited edition digital collections of
cards, books and similar items.

  <title>How To Make Purchases with Cryptocurrency on Ethair</title>
  <author><name>Ethair</name><email>boogs@ethair.com</email></author>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="content">
 <p>
Navigating a new purchasing system can be confusing, let alone one
with a completely different form of payment.
</p>

 <p>
Purchasing items with cryptocurrencies is still a relatively new
concept. Here is how the process will work on Ethair Marketplace.
</p>

 <p>
The initial portion is fairly straightforward and in line with most
other shopping sites.
</p>

 <p>
Once you have found an item to purchase, whether through auction or
traditional item posting, the following outlines what the process of
purchasing with crypto looks like on Ethair.
</p>

 <p>
If the item is up for auction then you’ll get to a bidding page.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/purchase.png" alt="purchase.png"></img> <figcaption> <span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Sample Bid Page</figcaption></figure> <p>
If your item is on a traditional listing then the page may look like
this:
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/another-purchase.png" alt="another-purchase.png"></img> <figcaption> <span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Sample Listing Page</figcaption></figure> <p>
In either of the above cases, when a product is listed in crypto,
underneath that price it is noted if the seller wants to also accept
 <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp">fiat</a> (local currency). It is also noted whether the seller only
accepts a specific cryptocurrency or multiple.
</p>

 <p>
All prices are based on current fiat and crypto rates. The price is
locked in at the time of purchase.
</p>

 <p>
After winning an auction or selecting an item, the item is placed in
user’s cart.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/shopping-cart.png" alt="shopping-cart.png"></img> <figcaption> <span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Sample Cart Page</figcaption></figure> <p>
Next you must complete the check-out steps.
</p>

 <p>
First, review that the shipping and billing addresses are correct.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/review-order.png" alt="review-order.png"></img> <figcaption> <span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>Sample Order Review Page</figcaption></figure> <p>
Then review your item, payment type, quantity and shipping
speed. Don’t forget to apply points if applicable.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/shipped.png" alt="shipped.png"></img></figure> <figure> <img src="../assets/reward-points.png" alt="reward-points.png"></img> <figcaption> <span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>Sample Shipping Page</figcaption></figure> <p>
Once all information is verified then you can place your order.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/place-order.png" alt="place-order.png"></img> <figcaption> <span class="figure-number">Figure 7: </span>Sample Order Summary</figcaption></figure> <p>
From here, the funds get deposited into a secure escrow account. The
taxes and fees are taken from here. The seller is notified that the
deposit has been made and then ships the item.
</p>

 <p>
Once the buyer receives the item, they then release the funds from
escrow and the seller is notified that the funds are available.
</p>

 <p>
If there is an issue with the item the buyer has the option of
starting the return process. We’ll discuss the return process in a
future article.
</p>

 <p>
We look forward to delving into more specifics and features while we
build up to the launch date!

  <title>Ethair Referral Program</title>
  <author><name>Ethair</name><email>boogs@ethair.com</email></author>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="content">
 <p>
Spreading the word about Ethair is a mutually beneficial action. We
get new users and you reap the benefits of our referral program.
</p>

 <p>
Each user is given a referral link to share with your friends and
family. Any verified users with your link will get counted toward your
total referrals. You can check your referral count, as well as
shareable personal link in your account, under Referral Activity.
</p>

 <p>
The referral rewards pay out at the end of every month based on the
percentage of new users you referred. Your number of referrals still
counts after the end of each month as the total is cumulative.
</p>

 <p>
The rewards you receive are a share of an ETHR token, our proprietary
crypto’s, reward pool. The EHTR token is accumulated on a monthly
basis depending on the number of points users have converted to
ETHR. Points are earned on each transaction.
</p>


 <figure> <img src="../assets/ethr-points.jpeg" alt="ethr-points.jpeg"></img></figure> <p>
The more transactions on the marketplace, the more points users earn
and can be converted to EHTR. This means the more people you refer,
the more beneficial the program is all around.
</p>

 <p>
At the end of each month, accumulated token value is distributed among
the referrers. The first payout will be will be by the end of the
quarter following our launch, or sooner if possible.
</p>

 <p>
When users on the platform exchange their earned points into EHTR
tokens, those points get multiplied by our smart contract. Every time
a user exchanges points for the token, an extra 50% worth of the token
is created. The referral pool gets 25% and the other 25% goes into a
company owned account. This is so the amount of tokens in the pool is
proportional to marketplace sales and requests exchange points can be
fulfilled.
</p>

 <p>
Users will be able to see the current number of reward tokens in the
pool in a pie chart that dynamically shows their share of the pool.
</p>

 <p>
Each user and each transaction can build up the amount of benefits
users get from utilizing our services. These passive rewards means the
time spent on our platform is productive to you and your actions on
our site.
