#+TITLE: Hi. We're Ethair.

In the last few years cryptocurrencies have exploded. What started
with Bitcoin has expanded as a form of microeconomics. However, one of
the downfalls has been how to spend these new currencies.

That’s where we come in.

Imagine being able to buy your everyday household items and much more
with the cryptocurrency you’ve amassed. We’ve made that a reality.

In the making since 2018 and launching in the third quarter of 2021 is
this new digital marketplace.

With Ethair, buyers and sellers have the flexibility to choose what
type of currency they deal in, either crypto or local currency. Local
currency transactions are processed through Stripe. Crypto payments
will be processed using a secure escrow account. Additionally, there
is the option to use a fixed price or an auction.

Both parties earn points with each transaction and those points can be
used for future transactions.

The current supported cryptos are: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin,
Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash and Z Cash. There are more to come
and this list is subject to change.

Users can fill out the [[https://www.ethair.com/][early registration form]] on the website now in
order to take advantage of the rewards pool. These rewards will be
revealed at a later date. There is also a referral system where users
get rewards for each member that signs up using their link.

The exact launch date is still TBD. There is so much more that Ethair
offers and more information will come as it get closer to launch!
