*Ethair Market is a next generation online global marketplace where you*
*can trade goods using fiat or cryptocurrency and earn points on every*
*purchase. The marketplace is soon to be launched in the U.S. and*
*Canada, with fiat payments support lined up for 43 more countries. You*
*can earn ETHR tokens now as an early registration reward and future*
*developments such as an NFT marketplace integration are already in the*
*works.*

*Introducing the Next Generation of eCommerce*

[[https://www.ethair.com][Ethair Market]] incorporates the modern technologies that the
traditional marketplaces are too afraid to tackle. It gives buyers and
sellers an ability to operate with fiat currencies as well as selected
cryptocurrencies. The developers have integrated Stripe for fiat
payments which will allow the marketplace to support 45 countries,
staying complaint with laws and regulations, and expand
internationally with ease. At the upcoming launch the system will
initially support the U.S. and Canada.

For purchases using cryptocurrencies Ethair Market utilizes an escrow
service which increases security on both ends of the spectrum as funds
are held by the marketplace while the goods are being delivered. If
something goes wrong during the process both parties may try to
resolve it themselves or involve Ethair Market to step in and
investigate. Escrow service gives both buyer and seller the security
that the funds will be rightly deposited on the item’s
arrival. Furthermore, it helps sellers deal with fraudulent buyers,
deterring them with escrow deposit and keeping the seller safe from
unexpected refunds.

EthairPay is the proprietary payment processing platform that will
allow users to make purchases and sales with cryptocurrency. It
currently supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar,
Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, USDC and Ethair Token. The goal is to
update this payment platform to such extent that third parties may
seamlessly integrate it with their stores as well as add support for
NFTs and Semi-NFTs on different blockchains.

The Points reward system gives points to both buyer and the seller on
each successful transaction. These points can be used to decrease the
price of future purchases or boost the listed item desirability, as
well as to mint ETHR tokens. Ethair Market’s ETHR Token allows for
transactions between buyer and the seller without additional
transaction fee charges. Fees which are drastically lower than on
traditional marketplaces are decreased even further with the Points
reward system.

Currently the only way to obtain ETHR token is via early registration,
where for limited time users earn 100 ETHR tokens [[https://www.ethair.com/][by signing up here]].
Ethair is also currently running a referral program for a 1 year
period where users are able to invite new users to the platform and
for every referred user that made a purchase they’ll earn a share of
ETHR Token from the Referral Program pool which is based upon the
number of Points to ETHR Token conversions.

*Cheapest Way to Sell Online*

If you are an online merchant looking to expand to a new platform that
treats you more fairly than the current marketplaces, Ethair Market is
the perfect place for you. For starters, Ethair Market has much lower
fees than the traditional markets, meaning that everything from
Insertion fees to FVF and various listing “upgrades” are lower than
most traditional marketplace fees.

With a Market (fixed price items, new items only) and “Buy Offer Bid”
(auction items, new or used) selling formats, you are able to sell as
a direct checkout as well as auctioning the items. *You sell, you
choose.* On top of traditional marketing schemes, Ethair Market offers
unique ways to promote your sales. For example, by adding Points to
your listings, you increase desirability with the buyers as they get
more rewards for purchasing your items.

The Ethair store manager allows you to easily manage your listings,
bulk upload, sync your listings count with your inventory stock and
across multiple selling platforms, easily message the sellers, check
which sales are pending shipping. Ethair Market also has multiple
return policy rules which allow you to select the return rules under
your own terms. Additional features allow you to customize your store
to your liking, create your own categories and sort items in order to
allow buyers to easily find desired items. You can also advertise
selected store categories only. And verified sellers even have the
ability to edit the store profile’s HTML code.

As for future developments, the next big step for Ethair is the
implementation of the NFT marketplace. This section is planned to have
drastically lower fees, help the buyers and the sellers who are not
tech savvy and introduce novelties to the whole system. Semi-NFTs are
also on the developers’ radar and the EthairPay payment processor is
on track to become compatible with every mintable state, as well as
different blockchain smart contracts.

Expansion into warehouse services is also on the list of future
developments, as Ethair’s goal is to offer the best from all the
traditional marketplaces and provide everything required for any type
of seller. Another plan is to include a social media platform
(“0xHello”) that would be inter-operable with the marketplace in order
to easily create, list and sell NFTs. This would create a new and
never seen before branch where influencers could potentially monetize
every post they make, sell limited edition digital collections of
cards, books and similar items.
