#+TITLE: How To Make Purchases with Cryptocurrency on Ethair

Navigating a new purchasing system can be confusing, let alone one
with a completely different form of payment.

Purchasing items with cryptocurrencies is still a relatively new
concept. Here is how the process will work on Ethair Marketplace.

The initial portion is fairly straightforward and in line with most
other shopping sites.

Once you have found an item to purchase, whether through auction or
traditional item posting, the following outlines what the process of
purchasing with crypto looks like on Ethair.

If the item is up for auction then you’ll get to a bidding page.

If your item is on a traditional listing then the page may look like
this:

In either of the above cases, when a product is listed in crypto,
underneath that price it is noted if the seller wants to also accept

accepts a specific cryptocurrency or multiple.

All prices are based on current fiat and crypto rates. The price is
locked in at the time of purchase.

After winning an auction or selecting an item, the item is placed in
user’s cart.

Next you must complete the check-out steps.

First, review that the shipping and billing addresses are correct.

Then review your item, payment type, quantity and shipping
speed. Don’t forget to apply points if applicable.

From here, the funds get deposited into a secure escrow account. The
taxes and fees are taken from here. The seller is notified that the
deposit has been made and then ships the item.

Once the buyer receives the item, they then release the funds from
escrow and the seller is notified that the funds are available.

If there is an issue with the item the buyer has the option of
starting the return process. We’ll discuss the return process in a
future article.

We look forward to delving into more specifics and features while we
build up to the launch date!
